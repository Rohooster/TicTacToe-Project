# Turns Idea: Have a counter variable, when counter on odd( x % 2 = 1) put an X on the board at location, when counter on even(x % 2 = 0), put an O on the location
# Turns Idea : Have a counter variable initialize this to zero. counter = 1-counter. If counter is 0 choose x if the counter is 1 choose y.
# 0
# 1 - 0 = 1
# 1 - 1 = 0
